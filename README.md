# Using Javascript on UFO Data

## Summary

In this project I am tasked with using javascript to sort through a dataset that consists of a vast amount of UFO sights taken over a period of time. My javascript code will communicate with a webpage in order to take in a date that a user inputs and output the specific UFO sight data from that particular Date and Time.

I started by creating a simple webpage with HTML and styled it with CSS. Adding any animations and input fields that my javascript would eventually end up using to sort through the dataset.

Then I started on my app.js file that would iterate over the array of objects in the data.js file. I wrote code that would append a table to the webpage and add new rows for each UFO sighting for the given date and time that was input by the user. I used a date form in my HTML document and wrote javascript code that would listen for events and search through the specific 'date/time' column to find the rows that match the user input.
