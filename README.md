# Using Javascript on UFO Data

## Summary

This project uses javascript to sort through a dataset that consists of a vast amount of UFO sightings taken over a period of time. The javascript code will communicate with a web page in order to take in a date that a user inputs and output the specific UFO sight data from that particular Date and Time.

## Web Page

Create a simple web page with HTML and style it with CSS. Adding any input fields that the javascript will eventually end up using to sort through the dataset.

* navbar - Clickable text that included an icon that sends you back to default page.
* Title/Header - Shows an eye-catching background and summarizes the web page.
* Filter Search bar - Allows user to input a date from the week provided by the dataset.

## Javascript

Next, start on the app.js file that will iterate over the array of objects in the data.js file. Write code that will append a table to the web page and add new rows for each UFO sighting for the given date that was input by the user. Use a date form in the HTML document and write javascript code that will listen for events and search through the specific 'date/time' column to find the rows that match the user input.

Finally, the user can use a beautiful web page that demonstrates how javascript, HTML, and CSS can come together and showcase data as well as streamline accessability of a dataset.
